  abstract = {Neural prosthetics may provide a promising solution to restore visual perception in some forms of blindness. The restored prosthetic percept is rudimentary compared to normal vision and can be optimized with a variety of image preprocessing techniques to maximize relevant information transfer. Extracting the most useful features from a visual scene is a nontrivial task and optimal preprocessing choices strongly depend on the context. Despite rapid advancements in deep learning, research currently faces a difficult challenge in finding a general and automated preprocessing strategy that can be tailored to specific tasks or user requirements. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning approach that explicitly addresses this issue by optimizing the entire process of phosphene generation in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed model is based on a deep auto-encoder architecture and includes a highly adjustable simulation module of prosthetic vision. In computational validation experiments, we show that such an approach is able to automatically find a task-specific stimulation protocol. The results of these proof-of-principle experiments illustrate the potential of end-to-end optimization for prosthetic vision. The presented approach is highly modular and our approach could be extended to automated dynamic optimization of prosthetic vision for everyday tasks, given any specific constraints, accommodating individual requirements of the end-user.},

  abstract = {Neuroprosthetic implants are a promising technology for restoring some form of vision in people with visual impairments via electrical neurostimulation in the visual pathway. Although an artificially generated prosthetic percept is relatively limited compared with normal vision, it may provide some elementary perception of the surroundings, re-enabling daily living functionality. For mobility in particular, various studies have investigated the benefits of visual neuroprosthetics in a simulated prosthetic vision paradigm with varying outcomes. The previous literature suggests that scene simplification via image processing, and particularly contour extraction, may potentially improve the mobility performance in a virtual environment. In the current simulation study with sighted participants, we explore both the theoretically attainable benefits of strict scene simplification in an indoor environment by controlling the environmental complexity, as well as the practically achieved improvement with a deep learning-based surface boundary detection implementation compared with traditional edge detection. A simulated electrode resolution of 26 × 26 was found to provide sufficient information for mobility in a simple environment. Our results suggest that, for a lower number of implanted electrodes, the removal of background textures and within-surface gradients may be beneficial in theory. However, the deep learning-based implementation for surface boundary detection did not improve mobility performance in the current study. Furthermore, our findings indicate that, for a greater number of electrodes, the removal of within-surface gradients and background textures may deteriorate, rather than improve, mobility. Therefore, finding a balanced amount of scene simplification requires a careful tradeoff between informativity and interpretability that may depend on the number of implanted electrodes.},

Federal and private entities are spending billions of dollars on visual prosthetics technologies. This review describes the most current and state-of-the-art bioengineering technologies to restore vision. This includes a thorough description of traditional electrode-based visual prosthetics that have improved substantially since early prototypes. Recent advances in molecular and synthetic biology have transformed vision-assisted technologies; For example, optogenetic technologies that introduce light-responsive proteins offer excellent resolution but cortical applications are restricted by fiber implantation and tissue damage. Other stimulation modalities, such as magnetic fields, have been explored to achieve non-invasive neuromodulation. Miniature magnetic coils are currently being developed to activate select groups of neurons. Magnetically-responsive nanoparticles or exogenous proteins can significantly enhance the coupling between external electromagnetic devices and any neurons affiliated with these modifications. The need to minimize cytotoxic effects for nanoparticle-based therapies will likely restrict the number of usable materials. Nevertheless, advances in identifying and utilizing proteins that respond to magnetic fields may lead to non-invasive, cell-specific stimulation and may overcome many of the limitations that currently exist with other methods. Finally, sensory substitution systems also serve as viable visual prostheses by converting visual input to auditory and somatosensory stimuli. This review also discusses major challenges in the field and offers bioengineering strategies to overcome those.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Neuroelectronics such as neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics provide a promising approach to diagnose and treat neurological diseases. However, the current neural interfaces are rigid and not biocompatible, so they induce an immune response and deterioration of neural signal transmission. Organic materials are promising candidates for neural interfaces, due to their mechanical softness, excellent electrochemical properties, and biocompatibility. Also, organic nervetronics, which mimics functional properties of the biological nerve system, is being developed to overcome the limitations of the complex and energy-consuming conventional neuroprosthetics that limit long-term implantation and daily-life usage. Examples of organic materials for neural interfaces and neural signal recordings are reviewed, recent advances of organic nervetronics that use organic artificial synapses are highlighted, and then further requirements for neuroprosthetics are discussed. Finally, the future challenges that must be overcome to achieve ideal organic neuroelectronics for next-generation neuroprosthetics are discussed.},

  abstract = {Visual neuroprostheses are a promising approach to restore basic sight in visually impaired people. A major challenge is to condense the sensory information contained in a complex environment into meaningful stimulation patterns at low spatial and temporal resolution. Previous approaches considered task-agnostic feature extractors such as edge detectors or semantic segmentation, which are likely suboptimal for specific tasks in complex dynamic environments. As an alternative approach, we propose to optimize stimulation patterns by end-to-end training of a feature extractor using deep reinforcement learning agents in virtual environments. We present a task-oriented evaluation framework to compare different stimulus generation mechanisms, such as static edge-based and adaptive end-to-end approaches like the one introduced here. Our experiments in Atari games show that stimulation patterns obtained via task-dependent end-to-end optimized reinforcement learning result in equivalent or improved performance compared to fixed feature extractors on high difficulty levels. These findings signify the relevance of adaptive reinforcement learning for neuroprosthetic vision in complex environments.},

This basic research has been hampered by the lack of a means to safely stimulate large numbers of cortical neurons. Recently, a number of laboratories have developed arrays of silicon microelectrodes that could enable such basic studies on phosphene psychophysics. This paper describes one such array, the Utah electrode array, and summarizes neurosurgical, physiological and histological experiments that suggest that such an array could be implanted safely in visual cortex. We also summarize a series of chronic behavioral experiments that show that modest levels of electrical currents passed into cortex via this array can evoke sensory percepts. Pending the successful outcome of biocompatibility studies using such arrays, high count arrays of penetrating microelectrodes similar to this design could provide a useful tool for studies of the psychophysics of phosphene perception in human volunteers. Such studies could provide a proof-of-concept for cortically based artificial vision. © 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Until now, the results of visual cortical prosthetics have been limited as no prosthesis has restored a full working vision but the field has shown a renewed interest these last years, thanks to wireless and technological advances. However, several scientific and technical challenges are still open to achieve the therapeutic benefit expected by these new devices. One of the main challenges is the electrical stimulation of the brain itself. In this review, we analyse the results in electrode-based visual cortical prosthetics from the electrical point of view. We first describe what is known about the electrode–tissue interface and safety of electrical stimulation. Then we focus on the psychophysics of prosthetic vision and the state-of-the-art on the interplay between the electrical stimulation of the visual cortex and the phosphene perception. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and perspectives of visual cortex electrical stimulation and electrode array design to develop the new generation implantable cortical visual prostheses.},

Fortunately today there is great public and scientific interest in making this happen, but it will only occur when the functional benefits of such systems outweigh the risks.

Schmidt et al (1996 Brain 119 507–22) reported that at low stimulation intensities their subject reported that phosphenes usually had a specific hue, but when the stimulus intensity was increased, they desaturated to white. We speculate here that previous B/W prosthetic systems were unnecessarily over-stimulating the visual cortex to obtain white phosphenes, which may be why unexpected alterations in phosphenes and seizures were not an uncommon occurrence. A color prosthesis would have the advantage of being elicited by lower levels of stimulation, reducing the probability of causing epileptogenic responses. Approach. A ‘hybrid’ mode of stimulation is suggested, involving a combination of B/W and color stimulation, which could provide color information without reducing spatial resolution. Main results. Colors in the real world are spread along intensity and chromatic gradients. Significance. Software implementation strategies are discussed, as are the advantages and challenges for possible color prosthetic systems.},

Recently, remarkable progress has been made in the field of processing algorithm for retinal prostheses where the new discovery of the retina’s working principle and state-of-the-arts computer vision models are combined together. Approach. We investigated the related research on artificial intelligence techniques for retinal prostheses. The processing algorithm in these studies could be attributed to three types: computer vision-related methods, biophysical models, and deep learning models. Main results. In this review, we first illustrate the structure and function of the normal and degenerated retina, then demonstrate the vision rehabilitation mechanism of three representative retinal prostheses. It is necessary to summarize the computational frameworks abstracted from the normal retina. In addition, the development and feature of three types of different processing algorithms are summarized. Finally, we analyze the bottleneck in existing algorithms and propose our prospect about the future directions to improve the restoration effect. Significance. This review systematically summarizes existing processing models for predicting the response of the retina to external stimuli. What’s more, the suggestions for future direction may inspire researchers in this field to design better algorithms for retinal prostheses.},

  abstract = {Objective. We developed a realistic simulation paradigm for cortical prosthetic vision and investigated whether we can improve visual performance using a novel clustering algorithm. Approach. Cortical visual prostheses have been developed to restore sight by stimulating the visual cortex. To investigate the visual experience, previous studies have used uniform phosphene maps, which may not accurately capture generated phosphene map distributions of implant recipients. The current simulation paradigm was based on the Human Connectome Project retinotopy dataset and the placement of implants on the cortices from magnetic resonance imaging scans. Five unique retinotopic maps were derived using this method. To improve performance on these retinotopic maps, we enabled head scanning and a density-based clustering algorithm was then used to relocate centroids of visual stimuli. The impact of these improvements on visual detection performance was tested. Using spatially evenly distributed maps as a control, we recruited ten subjects and evaluated their performance across five sessions on the Berkeley Rudimentary Visual Acuity test and the object recognition task. Main results. Performance on control maps is significantly better than on retinotopic maps in both tasks. Both head scanning and the clustering algorithm showed the potential of improving visual ability across multiple sessions in the object recognition task. Significance. The current paradigm is the first that simulates the experience of cortical prosthetic vision based on brain scans and implant placement, which captures the spatial distribution of phosphenes more realistically. Utilisation of evenly distributed maps may overestimate the performance that visual prosthetics can restore. This simulation paradigm could be used in clinical practice when making plans for where best to implant cortical visual prostheses.},

The aim of the article is, however, not to go over introductory material covered elsewhere, but rather to look ahead at exciting areas for likely future development. The BrainGate implant is focussed on in terms of its use as an interface between the Internet and the human nervous system. Sensory prosthetics of different types and deep brain stimulation are considered. Different possibilities with deep brain stimulation are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Despite the rapid progress and interest in brain-machine interfaces that restore motor function, the performance of prosthetic fingers and limbs has yet to mimic native function. The algorithm that converts brain signals to a control signal for the prosthetic device is one of the limitations in achieving rapid and realistic finger movements. To achieve more realistic finger movements, we developed a shallow feed-forward neural network to decode real-time two-degree-of-freedom finger movements in two adult male rhesus macaques. Using a two-step training method, a recalibrated feedback intention–trained (ReFIT) neural network is introduced to further improve performance. In 7 days of testing across two animals, neural network decoders, with higher-velocity and more natural appearing finger movements, achieved a 36\% increase in throughput over the ReFIT Kalman filter, which represents the current standard. The neural network decoders introduced herein demonstrate real-time decoding of continuous movements at a level superior to the current state-of-the-art and could provide a starting point to using neural networks for the development of more naturalistic brain-controlled prostheses.},
