  abstract = {Three-dimensional scaffolds for cellular organization need to enjoy a series of specific properties. On the one hand, the morphology, shape and porosity are critical parameters and eventually related with the mechanical properties. On the other hand, electrical conductivity is an important asset~when dealing with electroactive cells, so it is a desirable property even if the conductivity values are not particularly high. Here, we construct three-dimensional (3D) porous and conductive composites, where C8-D1A astrocytic cells were incubated to study their biocompatibility. The manufactured scaffolds are composed exclusively of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), a most promising material to interface with neuronal tissue, and polypyrrole (PPy), a conjugated polymer demonstrated to reduce gliosis, improve adaptability, and increase charge-transfer efficiency in brain-machine interfaces. We developed a new and easy strategy, based on the vapor phase polymerization (VPP) technique, where the monomer vapor is polymerized inside a sucrose sacrificial template containing CNT and an oxidizing agent. After removing the sucrose template, a 3D porous scaffold was obtained and its physical, chemical, and electrical properties were evaluated. The obtained scaffold showed very low density, high and homogeneous porosity, electrical conductivity, and Young’s Modulus similar to the in vivo tissue. Its high biocompatibility was demonstrated even after 6 days of incubation, thus paving the way for the development of new conductive 3D scaffolds potentially useful in the field of electroactive tissues.},

  abstract = {Implantable bioelectrodes have the potential to advance neural sensing and muscle stimulation, mainly in patients with peripheral nerve injuries. They function as the transducer at the interface between the damaged nerve and the muscle which is controlled by that nerve. This work reports the fabrication and characterization of novel, low-cost, flexible bioelectrodes based on polyaniline (PANI) and supported with silicone polymer. The fabricated electrodes were evaluated for their electrical and mechanical characteristics. PANI was used as the main transducer component in this fabrication. The characterization methods included electrical conductivity, capacitive behavior, long-term electrical impedance, and mechanical evaluation. The results of the fabricated PANI-silicone-based samples displayed a bulk impedance of 0.6 kΩ with an impedance of 1.6 kΩ at the frequency of 1 kHz. Furthermore, the bioelectrodes showed a charge storage capacity range from 0.0730 to 4.3124 C/cm2. The samples were stable when subjected to cyclic voltammetry tests. The bioelectrodes revealed very flexible mechanical properties as observed from the value of Young’s modulus (in the order of MPa) which was less than that of skin. Hence, the PANI-based bioelectrodes reported herein showed promising electrochemical characteristics with high flexibility.},

  abstract = {Retinal degenerative diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa cause a progressive loss of photoreceptors that eventually prevents the affected person from perceiving visual sensations. The absence of a visual input produces a neural rewiring cascade that propagates along the visual system. This remodeling occurs first within the retina. Then, subsequent neuroplastic changes take place at higher visual centers in the brain, produced by either the abnormal neural encoding of the visual inputs delivered by the diseased retina or as the result of an adaptation to visual deprivation. While retinal implants can activate the surviving retinal neurons by delivering electric current, the unselective activation patterns of the different neural populations that exist in the retinal layers differ substantially from those in physiologic vision. Therefore, artificially induced neural patterns are being delivered to a brain that has already undergone important neural reconnections. Whether or not the modulation of this neural rewiring can improve the performance for retinal prostheses remains a critical question whose answer may be the enabler of improved functional artificial vision and more personalized neurorehabilitation strategies.},

  abstract = {Wearable devices typically use electromagnetic fields for wireless information exchange. For implanted devices, electromagnetic signals suffer from a high amount of absorption in tissue, and alternative modes of transmission (ultrasound, optical and magneto-electric) cause large transduction losses due to energy conversion. To mitigate this challenge, we report biphasic quasistatic brain communication for wireless neural implants. The approach is based on electro-quasistatic signalling that avoids transduction losses and leads to an end-to-end channel loss of only around 60\,dB at a distance of 55\,mm. It utilizes dipole-coupling-based signal transfer through the brain tissue via differential excitation in the transmitter (implant) and differential signal pickup at the receiver (external hub). It also employs a series capacitor before the signal electrode to block d.c. current flow through the tissue and maintain ion balance. Since the electrical signal transfer through the brain is electro-quasistatic up to the several tens of megahertz, it provides a scalable (up to 10\,Mbps), low-loss and energy-efficient uplink from the implant to an external wearable. The transmit power consumption is only 0.52\,μW at 1\,Mbps (with 1\% duty cycling)—within the range of possible energy harvesting in the downlink from a wearable hub to an implant.},

  abstract = {Neural prosthetics may provide a promising solution to restore visual perception in some forms of blindness. The restored prosthetic percept is rudimentary compared to normal vision and can be optimized with a variety of image preprocessing techniques to maximize relevant information transfer. Extracting the most useful features from a visual scene is a nontrivial task and optimal preprocessing choices strongly depend on the context. Despite rapid advancements in deep learning, research currently faces a difficult challenge in finding a general and automated preprocessing strategy that can be tailored to specific tasks or user requirements. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning approach that explicitly addresses this issue by optimizing the entire process of phosphene generation in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed model is based on a deep auto-encoder architecture and includes a highly adjustable simulation module of prosthetic vision. In computational validation experiments, we show that such an approach is able to automatically find a task-specific stimulation protocol. The results of these proof-of-principle experiments illustrate the potential of end-to-end optimization for prosthetic vision. The presented approach is highly modular and our approach could be extended to automated dynamic optimization of prosthetic vision for everyday tasks, given any specific constraints, accommodating individual requirements of the end-user.},

  abstract = {Neuroprosthetic implants are a promising technology for restoring some form of vision in people with visual impairments via electrical neurostimulation in the visual pathway. Although an artificially generated prosthetic percept is relatively limited compared with normal vision, it may provide some elementary perception of the surroundings, re-enabling daily living functionality. For mobility in particular, various studies have investigated the benefits of visual neuroprosthetics in a simulated prosthetic vision paradigm with varying outcomes. The previous literature suggests that scene simplification via image processing, and particularly contour extraction, may potentially improve the mobility performance in a virtual environment. In the current simulation study with sighted participants, we explore both the theoretically attainable benefits of strict scene simplification in an indoor environment by controlling the environmental complexity, as well as the practically achieved improvement with a deep learning-based surface boundary detection implementation compared with traditional edge detection. A simulated electrode resolution of 26 × 26 was found to provide sufficient information for mobility in a simple environment. Our results suggest that, for a lower number of implanted electrodes, the removal of background textures and within-surface gradients may be beneficial in theory. However, the deep learning-based implementation for surface boundary detection did not improve mobility performance in the current study. Furthermore, our findings indicate that, for a greater number of electrodes, the removal of within-surface gradients and background textures may deteriorate, rather than improve, mobility. Therefore, finding a balanced amount of scene simplification requires a careful tradeoff between informativity and interpretability that may depend on the number of implanted electrodes.},

Federal and private entities are spending billions of dollars on visual prosthetics technologies. This review describes the most current and state-of-the-art bioengineering technologies to restore vision. This includes a thorough description of traditional electrode-based visual prosthetics that have improved substantially since early prototypes. Recent advances in molecular and synthetic biology have transformed vision-assisted technologies; For example, optogenetic technologies that introduce light-responsive proteins offer excellent resolution but cortical applications are restricted by fiber implantation and tissue damage. Other stimulation modalities, such as magnetic fields, have been explored to achieve non-invasive neuromodulation. Miniature magnetic coils are currently being developed to activate select groups of neurons. Magnetically-responsive nanoparticles or exogenous proteins can significantly enhance the coupling between external electromagnetic devices and any neurons affiliated with these modifications. The need to minimize cytotoxic effects for nanoparticle-based therapies will likely restrict the number of usable materials. Nevertheless, advances in identifying and utilizing proteins that respond to magnetic fields may lead to non-invasive, cell-specific stimulation and may overcome many of the limitations that currently exist with other methods. Finally, sensory substitution systems also serve as viable visual prostheses by converting visual input to auditory and somatosensory stimuli.

To this purpose, we first functionally recognized V6 by recording from neurons of the parieto-occipital cortex in awake macaque monkeys. Penetrations with recording syringes were performed in the behaving animals in order to inject tracers exactly at the recording sites. The tracers were injected into the central or peripheral field representation of V6 in different hemispheres. Irrespective of whether injections were made in the centre or periphery, area V6 showed reciprocal connections with areas V1, V2, V3, V3A, V4T, the middle temporal area /V5 (MT/V5), the medial superior temporal area (MST), the medial intraparietal area (MIP), the ventral intraparietal area (VIP), the ventral part of the lateral intraparietal area and the ventral part of area V6A (V6AV). No labelled cells or terminals were found in the inferior temporal, mesial and frontal cortices. The connections of V6 with V1, and with all the retinotopically organized prestriate areas, were organized retinotopically. The connection of V6 with MIP suggests a visuotopic organization for this latter. Labelling in V6A and VIP after either central or peripheral V6 injections was very similar in location and extent, as expected on the basis of the nonretinotopic organization of these areas. We suggest that V6 plays a pivotal role in the dorsal visual stream, by distributing the visual information coming from the occipital lobe to the sensorimotor areas of the parietal cortex. Given the functional characteristics of the cells of this network, we suggest that it could perform the fast form and motion analyses needed for the visual guiding of arm movements as well as their coordination with the eyes and the head.},

  abstract = {With significant advantages in rapidly restoring the nerve function, electrical stimulation of nervous tissue is a crucial treatment of peripheral nerve injuries leading to common movement disorder. However, the currently available stimulating electrodes generally based on rigid conductive materials would cause a potential mechanical mismatch with soft neural tissues which thus reduces long-term effects of electrical stimulation. Here, we proposed and fabricated a flexible neural microelectrode array system based on the liquid metal GaIn alloy (75.5\% Ga and 24.5\% In by weight) and via printing approach. Such an alloy with a unique low melting point (10.35 °C) owns excellent electrical conductivity and high compliance, which are beneficial to serve as implantable flexible neural electrodes. The flexible neural microelectrode array embeds four liquid metal electrodes and stretchable interconnects in a PDMS membrane (500 µm in thickness) that possess a lower elastic modulus (1.055 MPa), which is similar to neural tissues with elastic moduli in the 0.1–1.5 MPa range. The electrical experiments indicate that the liquid metal interconnects could sustain over 7000 mechanical stretch cycles with resistance approximately staying at 4 Ω. Over the conceptual experiments on animal sciatic nerve electrical stimulation, the dead bullfrog implanted with flexible neural microelectrode array could even rhythmically contract and move its lower limbs under the electrical stimulations from the implant. This demonstrates a highly efficient way for quickly recovering biological nerve functions. Further, the good biocompatibility of the liquid metal material was justified via a series of biological experiments. This liquid metal modality for neural stimulation is expected to play important roles as biologic electrodes to overcome the fundamental mismatch in mechanics between biological tissues and electronic devices in the coming time.},

  abstract = {Super-resolution optical imaging is crucial to the study of cellular processes. Current super-resolution fluorescence microscopy is restricted by the need of special fluorophores or sophisticated optical systems, or long acquisition and computational times. In this work, we present a deep-learning-based super-resolution technique of confocal microscopy. We devise a two-channel attention network (TCAN), which takes advantage of both spatial representations and frequency contents to learn a more precise mapping from low-resolution images to high-resolution ones. This scheme is robust against changes in the pixel size and the imaging setup, enabling the optimal model to generalize to different fluorescence microscopy modalities unseen in the training set. Our algorithm is validated on diverse biological structures and dual-color confocal images of actin-microtubules, improving the resolution from \textasciitilde\,230\,nm to \textasciitilde\,110\,nm. Last but not least, we demonstrate live-cell super-resolution imaging by revealing the detailed structures and dynamic instability of microtubules.},

Human-level visual recognition abilities are coming within reach of artificial systems. Artificial neural networks are inspired by the brain, and their computations could be implemented in biological neurons. Convolutional feedforward networks, which now dominate computer vision, take further inspiration from the architecture of the primate visual hierarchy. However, the current models are designed with engineering goals, not to model brain computations. Nevertheless, initial studies comparing internal representations between these models and primate brains find surprisingly similar representational spaces. With human-level performance no longer out of reach, we are entering an exciting new era, in which we will be able to build biologically faithful feedforward and recurrent computational models of how biological brains perform high-level feats of intelligence, including vision.},

  abstract = {Visual neuroprostheses are a promising approach to restore basic sight in visually impaired people. A major challenge is to condense the sensory information contained in a complex environment into meaningful stimulation patterns at low spatial and temporal resolution. Previous approaches considered task-agnostic feature extractors such as edge detectors or semantic segmentation, which are likely suboptimal for specific tasks in complex dynamic environments. As an alternative approach, we propose to optimize stimulation patterns by end-to-end training of a feature extractor using deep reinforcement learning agents in virtual environments. We present a task-oriented evaluation framework to compare different stimulus generation mechanisms, such as static edge-based and adaptive end-to-end approaches like the one introduced here. Our experiments in Atari games show that stimulation patterns obtained via task-dependent end-to-end optimized reinforcement learning result in equivalent or improved performance compared to fixed feature extractors on high difficulty levels. These findings signify the relevance of adaptive reinforcement learning for neuroprosthetic vision in complex environments.},

  abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) can improve the efficiency of learning wireless policies by leveraging their permutation properties and topology prior. While mismatched permutation property to a policy may degrade the learning performance and overlooked permutations incurs low sample efficiency, there is still lacking a systematical approach for modeling graph and designing structure of GNNs to harness all permutation properties. Moreover, the information of input feature may lose during updating hidden representations with GNNs, which leads to poor learning performance. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to learn permutable wireless policies with multidimensional GNNs, which update the hidden representations of hyper-edges to avoid the information loss. We provide a method to construct graph for a policy, over which a GNN with proper parameter sharing can exploit all possible permutations of the policy. We also investigate the permutability of wireless channels that affects the sample efficiency, and show how to trade off the training, inference, and design complexities of GNNs. To showcase how to design the GNNs within the framework, we consider precoding optimization in different systems. Simulation results validate the gain of the proposed GNNs over existing counterparts from exploiting the permutation prior and avoiding the information loss.},

Here, we report electrically conductive hydrogel-based elastic microelectronics with Young’s modulus values in the kilopascal range. The system consists of a highly conductive soft hydrogel as a conductor and an elastic fluorinated photoresist as the passivation insulation layer. Owing to the high volumetric capacitance and the passivation layer of the hydrogel, electrode arrays of the thin-film hydrogel ‘elastronics’, 20\,μm in feature size, show a significantly reduced interfacial impedance with tissue, a current-injection density that is \textasciitilde 30 times higher than that of platinum electrodes, and stable electrical performance under strain. We demonstrate the use of the soft elastronic arrays for localized low-voltage electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve in live mice.},

In addition to traditional electrodes, two new types of neural probes have been developed in recent years: optoprobes based on optogenetics and magnetrodes that record neural magnetic signals. In this review, we give a comprehensive overview of these three kinds of neural probes. We firstly discuss the development of microelectrodes and strategies for their flexibility, which is mainly represented by the selection of flexible substrates and new electrode materials. Subsequently, the concept of optogenetics is introduced, followed by the review of several novel structures of optoprobes, which are divided into multifunctional optoprobes integrated with microfluidic channels, artifact-free optoprobes, three-dimensional drivable optoprobes, and flexible optoprobes. At last, we introduce the fundamental perspectives of magnetoresistive (MR) sensors and then review the research progress of magnetrodes based on it.},

  abstract = {Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brain's specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.},

Although there are differences between these populations owing to the nature of the deprived sensory modality, there seem to be common principles regarding how the brain copes with sensory loss and the factors that influence neuroplastic changes.

This basic research has been hampered by the lack of a means to safely stimulate large numbers of cortical neurons. Recently, a number of laboratories have developed arrays of silicon microelectrodes that could enable such basic studies on phosphene psychophysics. This paper describes one such array, the Utah electrode array, and summarizes neurosurgical, physiological and histological experiments that suggest that such an array could be implanted safely in visual cortex. We also summarize a series of chronic behavioral experiments that show that modest levels of electrical currents passed into cortex via this array can evoke sensory percepts. Pending the successful outcome of biocompatibility studies using such arrays, high count arrays of penetrating microelectrodes similar to this design could provide a useful tool for studies of the psychophysics of phosphene perception in human volunteers. Such studies could provide a proof-of-concept for cortically based artificial vision. © 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, several scientific and technical challenges are still open to achieve the therapeutic benefit expected by these new devices. One of the main challenges is the electrical stimulation of the brain itself. In this review, we analyse the results in electrode-based visual cortical prosthetics from the electrical point of view. We first describe what is known about the electrode–tissue interface and safety of electrical stimulation. Then we focus on the psychophysics of prosthetic vision and the state-of-the-art on the interplay between the electrical stimulation of the visual cortex and the phosphene perception. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and perspectives of visual cortex electrical stimulation and electrode array design to develop the new generation implantable cortical visual prostheses.},

  abstract = {Transistors with tunable transconductance allow high-quality recordings of human brain rhythms.           ,                             Despite recent interest in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), sparked by their straightforward fabrication and high performance, the fundamental mechanism behind their operation remains largely unexplored. OECTs use an electrolyte in direct contact with a polymer channel as part of their device structure. Hence, they offer facile integration with biological milieux and are currently used as amplifying transducers for bioelectronics. Ion exchange between electrolyte and channel is believed to take place in OECTs, although the extent of this process and its impact on device characteristics are still unknown. We show that the uptake of ions from an electrolyte into a film of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) leads to a purely volumetric capacitance of 39 F/cm               3               . This results in a dependence of the transconductance on channel thickness, a new degree of freedom that we exploit to demonstrate high-quality recordings of human brain rhythms. Our results bring to the forefront a transistor class in which performance can be tuned independently of device footprint and provide guidelines for the design of materials that will lead to state-of-the-art transistor performance.},

Machine learning methods can be used to select effective stimulation protocols, but they require a model of the stimulated system to generate enough training data. Here, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) as a model of the ventral visual stream. A genetic algorithm drives the activation of the units in a layer of the CNN representing a cortical region toward a desired pattern, by refining the activation imposed at a layer representing the optic nerve. To simulate the pattern of activation elicited by the sites of an electrode array, a simple point-source model was introduced and its optimization process was investigated for static and dynamic scenes. Psychophysical data confirm that our stimulation evolution framework produces results compatible with natural vision. Machine learning approaches could become a very powerful tool to optimize and personalize neuroprosthetic systems.},

  abstract = {Objective. Cortical vision prostheses aim to restore visual percepts to those who have lost sight by delivering electrical stimulation to the visual cortex. These devices need to be implanted intracranially using subdural or intracortical microelectrodes, and should preferably dispense with the need of transcranial wiring. The risks of cortical tissue injury from mechanical trauma, material biocompatibility, heat generation, electrical stimulation and long-term immune responses need to be evaluated. In this paper, we investigate the biological response to a wireless cortical vision prosthesis (Gennaris array), by characterizing the histological changes that occur following chronic electrical stimulation. Approach. Ten arrays (7 active, 3 passive) were implanted in three sheep using a pneumatic insertor. Each device consisted of a wireless receiver and Application Specific Integrated Circuit encased in a ceramic box, and could deliver electrical stimulation through one of 43 electrodes. Main results. Stimulation was delivered through seven of these devices for up to 3 months and each device was treated as independent for further analysis. Cumulatively, over 2700 h of stimulation were achieved without any observable adverse health effects. Histology showed that the devices and implantation procedure were well tolerated by the brain with a similar tissue response to the more common Utah arrays. However, voltage transients across the stimulating electrodes were not measured so exact charge injection could not be verified. Significance. This work represents one of the first long-term tests of a fully implantable cortical vision prosthesis. The results indicate that long-term stimulation through wireless arrays can be achieved without induction of widespread tissue damage.},

Neural technology and science have advanced to the point that proof-of-concept systems exist for cortically-controlled prostheses in rats, monkeys, and even humans. However, realizing the dream of making such technology available to everyone is still far off. Fortunately today there is great public and scientific interest in making this happen, but it will only occur when the functional benefits of such systems outweigh the risks. In this article, the authors briefly summarize the state of the art and then highlight many issues that will directly limit clinical translation, including system durability, system performance, and patient risk. Despite the challenges, scientists and clinicians are in the desirable position of having both public and fiscal support to begin addressing these issues directly. The ultimate challenge now is to determine definitively whether these prosthetic systems will become clinical reality or forever unrealized.},

  abstract = {Objective. Electrical stimulation via microelectrodes implanted in cortex has been suggested as a potential treatment for a wide range of neurological disorders. Despite some success however, the effectiveness of conventional electrodes remains limited, in part due to an inability to create specific patterns of neural activity around each electrode and in part due to challenges with maintaining a stable interface. The use of implantable micro-coils to magnetically stimulate the cortex has the potential to overcome these limitations because the asymmetric fields from coils can be harnessed to selectively activate some neurons, e.g. vertically-oriented pyramidal neurons while avoiding others, e.g. horizontally-oriented passing axons. In vitro experiments have shown that activation is indeed confined with micro-coils but their effectiveness in the intact brain of living animals has not been evaluated. Approach. To assess the efficacy of stimulation, a 128-channel custom recording microelectrode array was positioned on the surface of the visual cortex (ECoG) in anesthetized mice and responses to magnetic and electric stimulation were compared. Stimulation was delivered from electrodes or micro-coils implanted through a hole in the center of the recording array at a rate of 200 pulses per second for 100 ms. Main results. Both electric and magnetic stimulation reliably elicited cortical responses, although activation from electric stimulation was spatially expansive, often extending more than 1 mm from the stimulation site, while activation from magnetic stimulation was typically confined to a ∼300 µm diameter region around the stimulation site. Results were consistent for stimulation of both cortical layer 2/3 and layer 5 as well as across a range of stimulus strengths. Significance. The improved focality with magnetic stimulation suggests that the effectiveness of cortical stimulation can be improved. Improved focality may be particularly attractive for cortical prostheses that require high spatial resolution, e.g. devices that target sensory cortex, as it may lead to improved acuity.},

Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence research have opened up new ways of thinking about neural computation. Many researchers are excited by the possibility that deep neural networks may offer theories of perception, cognition and action for biological brains. This approach has the potential to radically reshape our approach to understanding neural systems, because the computations performed by deep networks are learned from experience, and not endowed by the researcher. If so, how can neuroscientists use deep networks to model and understand biological brains? What is the outlook for neuroscientists who seek to characterize computations or neural codes, or who wish to understand perception, attention, memory and executive functions? In this Perspective, our goal is to offer a road map for systems neuroscience research in the age of deep learning. We discuss the conceptual and methodological challenges of comparing behaviour, learning dynamics and neural representations in artificial and biological systems, and we highlight new research questions that have emerged for neuroscience as a direct consequence of recent advances in machine learning.},

  abstract = {Objective. All of the human prosthetic visual systems implanted so far have been achromatic. Schmidt et al (1996 Brain 119 507–22) reported that at low stimulation intensities their subject reported that phosphenes usually had a specific hue, but when the stimulus intensity was increased, they desaturated to white. We speculate here that previous B/W prosthetic systems were unnecessarily over-stimulating the visual cortex to obtain white phosphenes, which may be why unexpected alterations in phosphenes and seizures were not an uncommon occurrence. A color prosthesis would have the advantage of being elicited by lower levels of stimulation, reducing the probability of causing epileptogenic responses. Approach. A ‘hybrid’ mode of stimulation is suggested, involving a combination of B/W and color stimulation, which could provide color information without reducing spatial resolution. Main results. Colors in the real world are spread along intensity and chromatic gradients. Significance. Software implementation strategies are discussed, as are the advantages and challenges for possible color prosthetic systems.},

The sensory neuron can be excited in multiple levels by synchronizing the two sensory cues, which enables the manipulating of skeletal myotubes and a robotic hand.

  abstract = {Objective. Retinal prostheses are promising devices to restore vision for patients with severe age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa disease. The visual processing mechanism embodied in retinal prostheses play an important role in the restoration effect. Its performance depends on our understanding of the retina’s working mechanism and the evolvement of computer vision models. Recently, remarkable progress has been made in the field of processing algorithm for retinal prostheses where the new discovery of the retina’s working principle and state-of-the-arts computer vision models are combined together. Approach. We investigated the related research on artificial intelligence techniques for retinal prostheses. The processing algorithm in these studies could be attributed to three types: computer vision-related methods, biophysical models, and deep learning models. Main results. In this review, we first illustrate the structure and function of the normal and degenerated retina, then demonstrate the vision rehabilitation mechanism of three representative retinal prostheses. It is necessary to summarize the computational frameworks abstracted from the normal retina. In addition, the development and feature of three types of different processing algorithms are summarized. Finally, we analyze the bottleneck in existing algorithms and propose our prospect about the future directions to improve the restoration effect. Significance. This review systematically summarizes existing processing models for predicting the response of the retina to external stimuli. What’s more, the suggestions for future direction may inspire researchers in this field to design better algorithms for retinal prostheses.},

  abstract = {Objective. We developed a realistic simulation paradigm for cortical prosthetic vision and investigated whether we can improve visual performance using a novel clustering algorithm. Approach. Cortical visual prostheses have been developed to restore sight by stimulating the visual cortex. To investigate the visual experience, previous studies have used uniform phosphene maps, which may not accurately capture generated phosphene map distributions of implant recipients. The current simulation paradigm was based on the Human Connectome Project retinotopy dataset and the placement of implants on the cortices from magnetic resonance imaging scans. Five unique retinotopic maps were derived using this method. To improve performance on these retinotopic maps, we enabled head scanning and a density-based clustering algorithm was then used to relocate centroids of visual stimuli. The impact of these improvements on visual detection performance was tested. Using spatially evenly distributed maps as a control, we recruited ten subjects and evaluated their performance across five sessions on the Berkeley Rudimentary Visual Acuity test and the object recognition task. Main results. Performance on control maps is significantly better than on retinotopic maps in both tasks. Both head scanning and the clustering algorithm showed the potential of improving visual ability across multiple sessions in the object recognition task. Significance. The current paradigm is the first that simulates the experience of cortical prosthetic vision based on brain scans and implant placement, which captures the spatial distribution of phosphenes more realistically. Utilisation of evenly distributed maps may overestimate the performance that visual prosthetics can restore. This simulation paradigm could be used in clinical practice when making plans for where best to implant cortical visual prostheses.},

  abstract = {Despite the rapid progress and interest in brain-machine interfaces that restore motor function, the performance of prosthetic fingers and limbs has yet to mimic native function. The algorithm that converts brain signals to a control signal for the prosthetic device is one of the limitations in achieving rapid and realistic finger movements. To achieve more realistic finger movements, we developed a shallow feed-forward neural network to decode real-time two-degree-of-freedom finger movements in two adult male rhesus macaques. Using a two-step training method, a recalibrated feedback intention–trained (ReFIT) neural network is introduced to further improve performance. In 7 days of testing across two animals, neural network decoders, with higher-velocity and more natural appearing finger movements, achieved a 36\% increase in throughput over the ReFIT Kalman filter, which represents the current standard. The neural network decoders introduced herein demonstrate real-time decoding of continuous movements at a level superior to the current state-of-the-art and could provide a starting point to using neural networks for the development of more naturalistic brain-controlled prostheses.},

  abstract = {The neural interface is a key component in wireless brain–computer prostheses. In this study, we demonstrate that a unique three-dimensional (3D) microneedle electrode on a flexible mesh substrate, which can be fabricated without complicated micromachining techniques, is conformal to the tissues with minimal invasiveness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it can be applied to different functional layers in the nervous system without length limitation. The microneedle electrode is fabricated using drawing lithography technology from biocompatible materials. In this approach, the profile of a 3D microneedle electrode array is determined by the design of a two-dimensional (2D) pattern on the mask, which can be used to access different functional layers in different locations of the brain. Due to the sufficient stiffness of the electrode and the excellent flexibility of the mesh substrate, the electrode can penetrate into the tissue with its bottom layer fully conformal to the curved brain surface. Then, the exposed contact at the end of the microneedle electrode can successfully acquire neural signals from the brain.},

  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography is a non-invasive, cost-efficient technique that provides high-resolution in vivo imaging of retinal tissue. The peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer and macular ganglion cell complex are surrogate markers of neuroaxonal integrity in not only the eye, but also the CNS. Retinal atrophy may occur in tandem with CNS pathologies as a result of injury to ganglion cells, direct degeneration of the pregeniculate pathway, or retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration secondary to postgeniculate lesions. In this review, we outline the basic principles of optical coherence tomography and discuss its application to managing patients with demyelinating disorders, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, stroke, neurodegenerative conditions, and mitochondrial disorders. We demonstrate that measurements of peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer and macular ganglion cell complex thickness are paramount in diagnosing and monitoring neurological disorders, including those with subclinical disease progression.},

  abstract = {Cerebral neural electronics play a crucial role in neuroscience research with increasing translational applications such as brain–computer interfaces for sensory input and motor output restoration. While widely utilized for decades, the understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying this technology remains limited. Although two-photon microscopy (TPM) has shown great promise in imaging superficial neural electrodes, its application to deep-penetrating electrodes is technically difficult. Here, a novel device integrating transparent microelectrode arrays with glass microprisms, enabling electrophysiology recording and stimulation alongside TPM imaging across all cortical layers in a vertical plane, is introduced. Tested in Thy1-GCaMP6 mice for over 4 months, the integrated device demonstrates the capability for multisite electrophysiological recording/stimulation and simultaneous TPM calcium imaging. As a proof of concept, the impact of microstimulation amplitude, frequency, and depth on neural activation patterns is investigated using the setup. With future improvements in material stability and single unit yield, this multimodal tool greatly expands integrated electrophysiology and optical imaging from the superficial brain to the entire cortical column, opening new avenues for neuroscience research and neurotechnology development.},

  abstract = {Proposed 3D neural electrode can self-climb onto peripheral nerve driven by body temperature and form flexible neural interface.           ,              Peripheral neuromodulation has been widely used throughout clinical practices and basic neuroscience research. However, the mechanical and geometrical mismatches at current electrode-nerve interfaces and complicated surgical implantation often induce irreversible neural damage, such as axonal degradation. Here, compatible with traditional 2D planar processing, we propose a 3D twining electrode by integrating stretchable mesh serpentine wires onto a flexible shape memory substrate, which has permanent shape reconfigurability (from 2D to 3D), distinct elastic modulus controllability (from \textasciitilde 100 MPa to \textasciitilde 300 kPa), and shape memory recoverability at body temperature. Similar to the climbing process of twining plants, the temporarily flattened 2D stiff twining electrode can naturally self-climb onto nerves driven by 37°C normal saline and form 3D flexible neural interfaces with minimal constraint on the deforming nerves. In vivo animal experiments, including right vagus nerve stimulation for reducing the heart rate and action potential recording of the sciatic nerve, demonstrate the potential clinical utility.},
