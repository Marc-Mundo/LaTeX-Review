\section*{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
\subsection*{Background}
Globally, blindness affects millions of people, with estimates rising from over
30 million in 2013 to 43.3 million in
2020~\parencite{stevensGlobalPrevalenceVision2013,
      bourneTrendsPrevalenceBlindness2021}. For certain types of blindness, visual
prosthetics present a promising avenue for restoring rudimentary vision through
electrical stimulation of the visual system. The concept of using bioelectrical
interfaces dates back to the 18th century, with pioneering experiments by LeRoy
in 1755 and Volta in 1800 demonstrating that electrical stimulation of the eye
can induce visual sensations.

The field of neuroprosthetics has witnessed remarkable progress, particularly
with the advent of visual cortical prostheses. These advanced devices offer hope
for restoring vision in individuals with severe visual impairments by
interfacing directly with the brain's visual cortex
(Figure~\ref{fig:schematic}). Visual cortical prostheses work by converting
visual information from the external environment into neural signals that the
brain can process, effectively bypassing damaged visual pathways. The core
technology involves the generation of phosphenes---perceived spots of light
resulting from electrical stimulation of the visual
cortex~\parencite{vandergrintenBiologicallyPlausiblePhosphene2024a}. However,
organizing these phosphenes into coherent and interpretable visual patterns
remains a significant challenge~\parencite{merabetWhatBlindnessCan2005}.

      \caption{| Functional schematic representation of a visual cortical
            prosthesis. The visual environment is recorded by a wearable camera
            and sent to a (wireless) mobile computer. Electrodes within a brain
            implant are then selectively activated to stimulate neurons in the
            primary visual cortex (V1). By leveraging the retinotopic
            organization of V1, a precise pattern of phosphenes is created,
            forming a coherent representation of the visual
            scene~\parencite{chenShapePerceptionHighchannelcount2020}. (Image:

\end{figure*}

AI has emerged as a pivotal element in enhancing these prosthetic systems. By
leveraging sophisticated algorithms, AI can optimize stimulation patterns to
create more naturalistic visual experiences for
users~\parencite{kriegeskorteDeepNeuralNetworks2015}. AI's role extends to real-time
image processing, allowing the prosthesis to adapt to varying visual
environments and tasks~\parencite{marblestoneIntegrationDeepLearning2016}. This
capability is crucial for developing prosthetic systems that closely mimic
natural vision, providing users with more effective and adaptable solutions. The
integration of AI not only improves the functionality of these devices but also
opens new avenues for innovation in how visual information is processed and
perceived~\parencite{gallettiCorticalConnectionsArea2001}.

This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of visual cortical
prostheses, focusing on the role of AI in advancing these prosthetics. By
examining current capabilities, identifying limitations, and proposing future
research directions, this work seeks to contribute to the ongoing development of
more effective and user-friendly visual prosthetic systems. Combining
technological innovation with neuroscientific insights has the profound
potential to enhance the quality of life for individuals with visual
impairments.

with neural tissue and more precise stimulation of the visual
cortex~\parencite{luGraphenebasedNeurotechnologiesAdvanced2018}.

Additionally, gold nanostructures have been utilized to enhance electrode
performance. Gold nanoparticles and nanowires can be used to modify the surface
of electrodes, increasing their surface area and improving their electrical
properties. This modification can lead to more efficient charge transfer and

tissues~\parencite{liuSoftElasticHydrogelbased2019}. Advances in 3D printing
materials, including biocompatible and conductive inks, have improved the
performance and longevity of printed electrodes, providing the necessary
electrical properties while maintaining compatibility with neural tissue.

Additionally, the ability to rapidly prototype and produce electrodes using 3D
printing reduces manufacturing time and cost, facilitating quicker iterations
and refinements in electrode design, which accelerates the development
process~\parencite{zhangClimbinginspiredTwiningElectrodes2019}. Recent studies
have demonstrated the potential in creating flexible and biocompatible
electrodes, advancing the state-of-the-art in visual cortical prostheses.

\subsection*{Improved Signal Processing and Integration}

that has been extensively used in neural prosthetics. OCT provides
cross-sectional images of the brain's surface, enabling detailed visualization
of cortical layers and structures. This level of detail allows for the precise
placement of electrodes, improving the effectiveness and safety of neural
stimulation~\parencite{xieUseOpticalCoherence2022}.

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides high-resolution images of
brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow. This imaging
technique is valuable for mapping functional areas of the brain, ensuring that
electrodes are placed in regions that will yield the most beneficial outcomes
for the user~\parencite{landelleInvestigatingHumanSpinal2021}.

Two-photon microscopy allows for deep imaging of living brain tissue with high
spatial resolution. This technique is particularly useful for observing the
interactions between electrodes and neural tissue over time, providing insights
that can guide the design and optimization of electrode
arrays~\parencite{yangIntegratedMicroprismMicroelectrode2024}.

Furthermore, the development of NIR-II semiconducting polymers has enhanced in
vivo high-resolution imaging capabilities. These polymers offer excellent
penetration depth and spatial resolution, which are critical for accurate
diagnostics and therapeutic applications in neural prosthetics~\parencite{wangRecentProgressSecond2023,kangNIRIISemiconductingPolymers2023}.

Deep learning techniques have also been employed to enhance the resolution of

ensuring reliable and efficient
operation~\parencite{rosenfeldTissueResponseChronically2020}.

Recent advancements include the development of biphasic quasistatic brain
communication (BP-QBC), a technique that significantly reduces power consumption
while maintaining high data transfer rates. This method leverages
electro-quasistatic signaling to create a low-power, broadband communication
channel between wireless neural implants and external devices, offering a
promising solution for energy-efficient and high-speed data transmission in
neural prosthetics~\parencite{chatterjeeBiphasicQuasistaticBrain2023}.

Another innovative approach is the use of feed-forward neural networks to
improve the control of brain-machine interfaces. This simpler neural network
architecture enhances the speed and accuracy of prosthetic control by more
closely mimicking the natural communication pathways between the brain and the
body. Such advancements not only improve the functionality of prosthetic devices
but also enhance their usability for individuals with paralysis or limb
loss~\parencite{willseyRealtimeBrainmachineInterface2022}.

Moreover, multidimensional graph neural networks (GNNs) have been employed to
optimize wireless communication policies in neural prosthetics. These networks
use graph-based representations to manage complex data transmission scenarios,
improving the efficiency and reliability of wireless communication between
implants and external devices~\parencite{liuMultidimensionalGraphNeural2024}.

These advancements in wireless communication technology are crucial for the
development of next-generation visual cortical prostheses, providing users with
more seamless and reliable neural interfaces.

\subsection*{Software and Algorithmic Enhancements}
On the software side, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has
revolutionized the way visual information is processed and interpreted by
prosthetic systems. AI algorithms, particularly those based on deep learning,
have been employed to optimize stimulation patterns and enhance image processing
capabilities. These algorithms can learn from vast amounts of data to improve
the accuracy and efficiency of visual signal conversion, making the visual
experiences more naturalistic and adaptable to different
environments~\parencite{romeniMachineLearningFramework2021}.

\subsubsection*{Real-Time Data Processing}
Real-time data processing is pivotal in the functionality of visual cortical
prostheses. It enables the seamless translation of visual information from the
external environment into neural signals that can be interpreted by the brain's
visual cortex.

A key aspect of real-time data processing involves the integration of high-speed
computing systems capable of handling large volumes of visual data with minimal
latency~\parencite{nurmikkoChallengesLargeScaleCortical2020}. The processing
pipeline typically includes capturing visual information via cameras,
preprocessing the data to reduce noise and enhance relevant features, and
converting this data into neural stimulation patterns.

Edge computing plays a crucial role in this pipeline by performing data
processing closer to the data source. This reduces latency and enhances the
responsiveness of the prosthetic system, which is particularly important for
real-time applications such as navigation in dynamic
environments~\parencite{wangDeepLearningEdge2020}. By offloading computational
tasks from centralized servers to local devices, edge computing ensures that
visual data is processed swiftly, enabling immediate feedback to the user.

Another important component is the use of adaptive algorithms that can
dynamically adjust to changes in the visual environment. These algorithms
leverage feedback from the user's interactions with the prosthetic system to
continuously improve accuracy and
effectiveness~\parencite{pio-lopezVisualCorticalProsthesis2021b}. For example,
real-time adjustments can be made to the stimulation patterns based on
environmental factors such as lighting conditions and the presence of moving
objects, ensuring that the visual output remains consistent and
coherent~\parencite{fylstraHumanprosthesisCooperationCombining2022}.

Additionally, advancements in sensor technology have significantly contributed
to real-time data processing capabilities. High-resolution cameras and depth
sensors provide detailed visual information, which is essential for generating
precise and informative neural signals. These sensors can capture a wide range
of visual cues, including color, depth, and motion, which are then processed to
create a comprehensive visual experience for the
user~\parencite{rueckauerExperiencingProstheticVision2022}.

Real-time data processing also benefits from the development of specialized
hardware accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field
Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs)~\parencite{springerOnDeviceDeepLearning2021,fengDesignOnlineBrainComputer2020}
These devices are optimized for parallel processing tasks and can handle the
intensive computational demands of real-time visual data processing. By
utilizing these hardware accelerators, visual cortical prostheses can achieve
the necessary processing speeds to provide immediate and accurate visual
feedback.

In summary, real-time data processing in visual cortical prostheses involves a
combination of high-speed computing, edge computing, adaptive algorithms,
advanced sensors, and specialized hardware accelerators. These systems work
together to ensure that visual information is processed and transmitted to the
brain without noticeable delays, creating a natural and effective visual
experience for users. This seamless integration of hardware and software
components is crucial for the ongoing development and enhancement of visual
prosthetic systems.

feedback mechanisms of the human visual system, providing a more responsive and
user-friendly experience. Recent research has demonstrated the efficacy of these
systems in improving the visual outcomes for users, as they can dynamically
adapt to changes in the environment and the user's neural
responses~\parencite{leviEditorialClosedLoopSystems2018}.

\subsubsection*{Multi-Modal Sensory Integration}
The integration of multi-modal sensory input is another promising development in
this field. By incorporating inputs from other senses, such as auditory or
tactile feedback, visual cortical prostheses can provide a more holistic sensory
experience. This multi-modal approach leverages the brain's ability to integrate
information from different sensory modalities, potentially enhancing the overall
perceptual experience and aiding in the interpretation of visual
scenes~\parencite{wanArtificialSensoryNeuron2020}.

\subsubsection*{Neuroplasticity and Rehabilitation}
Advancements in understanding neuroplasticity have led to improved
rehabilitation strategies for users of visual cortical prostheses.
Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming
new neural connections. Rehabilitation programs that stimulate neural
reorganization can enhance the integration and functionality of prosthetic
devices. These programs often involve specific training protocols designed to
help users better interpret and respond to visual stimuli, ultimately improving
their overall visual experience.

\section*{AI Integration}\label{sec:ai_integration}
The integration of AI in visual prosthesis systems is focused on how deep
learning algorithms enhance visual data processing, optimize phosphene patterns,
and emulate normal brain processing. Figure~\ref{fig:simulator_framework}
provides an overview of a Visual Prosthesis Simulation Framework based on the
work by~\textcite{deruytervansteveninckEndtoendOptimizationProsthetic2022}. This
framework employs AI to simulate and predict how users perceive visual
information through a prosthetic device. By integrating deep learning
algorithms, the system can accurately replicate and enhance visual experiences.

The functional process of a visual cortical prosthesis in this framework is an
end-to-end process that includes three main components: an encoder, a phosphene
simulator, and a decoder. The encoder processes the input image to generate a
stimulation protocol, which determines the intensity of stimulation for each
electrode. The phosphene simulator translates this protocol into a simulated
phosphene vision (SPV) representation, incorporating factors like distortions in
phosphene positions and brightness variations. Finally, the decoder reconstructs
the input image from the SPV representation, ensuring accurate interpretation of
the encoded information.

Optimization is a critical aspect, involving automated and tailored adjustments
to achieve the best visual reconstruction. Task-specific optimization is
implemented by using different loss functions, guiding the network to preserve
relevant information. Constraints such as sparsity can be incorporated to
minimize adverse effects of electrical stimulation. The modular design allows
the system to adapt to practical, medical, or biophysical limitations. Some
designs, such as the one
by~\textcite{deruytervansteveninckEndtoendOptimizationProsthetic2022}, has been
made open-source to facilitate collaboration and further development.

      \caption{| Overview of a Visual Prosthesis Simulation Framework. The
            simulator is initialized with electrode locations on a visuotopic
            map of the visual cortex (V1), representing the spatial organization
            of the visual field. For each frame, it processes stimulation
            parameters such as amplitude, pulse width, and frequency for each
            electrode. Using these parameters and electrode locations, it
            estimates phosphene characteristics, which are rendered on a visual
            field map considering cortical magnification and activation
            thresholds. Individual phosphene renderings are summed to produce
            the simulated prosthetic percept. Temporal dynamics, including
            delayed onset and offset of perception, are modeled using a leaky
            integrator. The simulator's modular and open-source design,
            implemented in Python with PyTorch for example, allows for fast GPU
            computations and easy integration with external
            software~\parencite{deruytervansteveninckEndtoendOptimizationProsthetic2022}.
            It is validated through computational and behavioral experiments,
            incorporating neurophysiological and clinical findings to ensure
            biological plausibility.}\label{fig:simulator_framework}

\subsection*{Deep Learning Algorithms in Prosthetic Vision}
So why are AI algorithms essential for the development of prosthetic vision?
These algorithmic models are in principle, designed as solutions to low sampling
resolution. The optimization of phosphene patterns are an area that benefits
significantly from preprocessing optimizations of image quality. An example of a
spiking neural network is the NeoCube architecture for obstacle-avoidance
by~\textcite{guoOptimizationVisualInformation2018}. This architecture is a prime
example of how an AI system can enhance the user experience by adding increased
stability and accuracy to the prosthetic system, without the addition of
additional hardware.

Deep learning models are different kinds of neural networks that are used to
predict and interpret visual inputs without providing environmental context.
This is known as saliency mapping, which is an important technique used in deep
learning to identify and visualize the regions of an input that most
significantly influence the model's predictions. Within the deep learning domain
there are however several types of neural networks that are used to enhance the
capabilities of models in different ways.

Various types of neural networks exist, including Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) for image recognition, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal data
processing, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating realistic
visual patterns, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for understanding complex
spatial relationships, that collectively enhance capabilities in image
translation, object recognition, and scene interpretation. These key deep
learning algorithms are crucial in predictive modeling, with each contributing
uniquely to improving the functionality and performance of visual cortical
prostheses.

\subsubsection*{Predictive Modeling}
Predictive modeling plays a crucial role in prosthetic vision by leveraging
various deep learning algorithms to enhance visual perception for users. These
models are designed to predict and interpret visual inputs, creating a seamless
and coherent visual experience. By utilizing large datasets and advanced neural
network architectures, predictive modeling enables the prosthetic system to
anticipate and adapt to dynamic visual environments. Aforementioned key deep
learning algorithms are employed in predictive modeling, these include CNNs,
RNNs, GANs, and Multidimensional GNNs.

      \end{tabularx}
\end{table*}

\subsubsection*{Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)}
CNNs are employed to process and classify visual inputs, enhancing the ability
of the prosthetic system to interpret complex visual scenes and improve object
recognition capabilities. CNNs are particularly effective at identifying spatial
hierarchies in images through layers of convolutions that capture features like
edges, textures, and shapes. By training on large datasets, CNNs learn to
recognize a wide range of objects and scenes, enabling the prosthetic system to
provide users with detailed and accurate visual
information~\parencite{petrosyanDecodingInterpretingCortical2021a}. This improves the
user's ability to navigate and interact with their environment by providing
clearer and more recognizable visual
cues~\parencite{maheswaranathanInterpretingRetinalNeural2023}.

\subsubsection*{Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)}
RNNs, including LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, are used to handle
sequential data, making it possible to maintain temporal continuity in visual
perception and improve the user's ability to track moving objects. Unlike CNNs,
which focus on spatial relationships, RNNs excel at processing temporal
sequences. They retain information over time, allowing them to predict future
frames based on past visual data. This capability is essential for maintaining a
continuous and stable visual experience, especially when tracking dynamic scenes
or moving objects, thereby enhancing the user's perception of motion and
improving their ability to react to changes in their
environment~\parencite{nayebiRecurrentConnectionsPrimate2022, liaoBridgingGapsResidual2016}.

\subsubsection*{Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)}
GANs are utilized to generate realistic phosphene patterns by training on large
datasets of visual scenes, improving the fidelity and natural appearance of the
visual output. A GAN consists of two neural networks, a generator and a
discriminator, which are trained together in a competitive process. The
generator creates synthetic images that the discriminator attempts to
distinguish from real images. Through this adversarial training, GANs learn to
produce high-quality, realistic images that can be used to simulate
phosphenes—patterns of light perceived by the visual
cortex~\parencite{goodfellowGenerativeAdversarialNetworks2020,elnabawyPVGANGenerativeAdversarial2022}.
This enhances the naturalness and coherence of the visual scenes presented to
the user, making the prosthetic vision more similar to natural sight.

\subsubsection*{Multidimensional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)}
GNNs are leveraged to model and interpret complex relationships within
multidimensional data, enhancing the system's ability to understand and process
spatial and relational information. GNNs extend traditional neural networks by
operating on graph-structured data, which can represent the spatial
relationships between objects in a scene. This allows the prosthetic system to
better understand the context and interactions within the visual input. By
capturing these intricate relationships, GNNs improve the prosthetic's ability
to recognize patterns, structures, and spatial hierarchies, leading to more
accurate and context-aware visual perception. This is particularly useful in
complex environments where understanding the spatial arrangement of objects is
crucial for navigation and
interaction~\parencite{subramanianGraphConvolutionalNetworks2020,wuComprehensiveSurveyGraph2021}.

\section*{Comparison with Other Visual Prosthetic Systems}\label{sec:comparison}
Cortical prosthetics offer a unique approach to restoring vision compared to
earlier retinal and optic nerve implants. Devices by companies like the
\textit{PRIMA system} and \textit{IRIS} systems by Pixium-Vision or the
\textit{Orion} and \textit{ARGUSII} (FDA-approved) by Second Sight Medical
Products Inc have already proven their merit. However, cortical prostheses are
distinguished by their downstream positioning, which provides substantial
rehabilitative potential for individuals who are blind or visually impaired,
especially when retinal or optic nerve prostheses are
ineffective~\parencite{tzekovGabelEdArtificial2020}. These implants also allow
for the longest therapeutic intervention window. Instead of complete neural
degeneration, post-injury compensatory plasticity mechanisms recruit neurons
from other cortical regions, enabling effective stimulation well beyond the
onset of injury or disease~\parencite{beyelerLearningSeeAgain2017}.
